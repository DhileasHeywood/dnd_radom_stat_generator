# Python Web App
# Made using Flask

## Project Aims:

* Make a class, Character, that has the stats of a Dungeons and Dragons character
* Make methods to acquire the character's attributes and modifiers
* Turn this into a web app, where a user can input a character name, and the character's statistics will be shown

## Future Aims
* Expand the random character generator to include race, class and background.
* Allow for user selection of races and classes to include, since most players don't want a truly random character.
